# Hand Gesture Recognition API

## Monitoring Metrics

Effective monitoring is paramount for maintaining the health, performance, and reliability of our Hand Gesture Recognition API in a production environment. It provides real-time insights, enables proactive issue detection, and helps ensure the model performs optimally under live conditions.

We will focus on monitoring the following key areas:

### 1. Model-Related: Prediction Latency

* **Reasoning:**
    * **User Experience (UX):** In a real-time application like gesture recognition, high latency directly translates to a sluggish and frustrating user experience. Monitoring latency ensures the API remains responsive.
    * **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** We might have committed to delivering predictions within a specific timeframe. Latency monitoring is essential for verifying adherence to these agreements.
    * **Performance Bottlenecks:** Spikes in prediction latency can indicate inefficiencies in the model, resource contention (CPU/memory), or issues with underlying infrastructure, guiding performance optimization efforts.

* **Implementation (Conceptual):**
    * **Measurement:** The time taken from when the API receives a prediction request to when it sends back the response will be measured. This can be achieved using a timing decorator or middleware applied to the `/predict` endpoint in the FastAPI application.
    * **Tools:** Integrate with a monitoring system like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to collect time-series latency metrics (e.g., total duration, count, and sum). These metrics can then be visualized in [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), allowing us to observe average, 90th percentile (P90), and 99th percentile (P99) latency over time.
    * **Alerting:** Set up alerts (e.g., using [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/)) to trigger if the P99 prediction latency exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 500ms) for a continuous period.

### 2. Data-Related: Input Data Distribution / Data Drift

* **Reasoning:**
    * **Model Performance Degradation (Data Drift):** Machine learning models are trained on historical data with a specific statistical distribution. If the characteristics of the incoming live prediction data (e.g., feature ranges, correlations) start to change significantly over time, the model's accuracy and reliability will degrade silently. This phenomenon is known as data drift or concept drift.
    * **Preventing Silent Failures:** Unlike explicit errors (e.g., 500 HTTP status codes), data drift often doesn't cause the application to crash but leads to inaccurate or less effective predictions, making it a "silent failure." Monitoring input data helps detect these issues early.
    * **Debugging and Root Cause Analysis:** Unexpected model behavior can often be traced back to changes in the input data. Comprehensive data monitoring provides valuable context for debugging and identifying the root cause of performance dips.

* **Implementation (Conceptual):**
    * **Feature Statistics Logging:** For critical input features (e.g., `x1`, `y1`, `z1`, etc.), statistical summaries (mean, standard deviation, min, max, quantiles) will be calculated for incoming requests (e.g., for every N requests or in batches over time).
    * **Baseline Comparison:** These live statistics will be continuously compared against the baseline statistics derived from the model's training dataset.
    * **Tools:** Log these statistical summaries to a structured logging system (e.g., [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack), [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/), or a dedicated data warehouse). Specialized MLOps tools or libraries like [Evidently AI](https://evidentlyai.com/) can also be employed for automated drift detection and reporting.
    * **Alerting:** Configure alerts to notify stakeholders if critical feature statistics deviate by more than a set threshold (e.g., a certain percentage or number of standard deviations) from the training data baseline for a sustained period.

### 3. Server-Related: Request Rate (RPS) & Error Rate (HTTP 5xx)

* **Reasoning:**
    * **Request Rate (RPS - Requests Per Second):**
        * **Load Assessment:** Provides immediate insight into the current demand on the API, helping to identify peak usage patterns.
        * **Capacity Planning:** Essential for making informed decisions about scaling the infrastructure (e.g., adding more container instances, allocating more CPU/memory) to handle anticipated or unexpected increases in traffic.
        * **Anomaly Detection:** Sudden, unexplained drops in RPS could indicate issues with upstream services calling the API, while uncharacteristic spikes might signal a denial-of-service attempt.
    * **Error Rate (HTTP 5xx - Server-Side Errors):**
        * **Immediate Issue Detection:** A significant increase in HTTP 5xx errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable) is the most critical indicator of a severe problem within the API's core logic, its dependencies (e.g., model loading failure, database connectivity), or the underlying server infrastructure.
        * **Availability & Reliability:** Directly reflects the API's operational status and its ability to serve consumers. A high 5xx error rate means the service is largely unavailable or heavily degraded.

* **Implementation (Conceptual):**
    * **Measurement:** Standard HTTP request metrics, including total requests, requests per second, and breakdown by HTTP status code (2xx, 4xx, 5xx), will be automatically collected. This can be achieved using FastAPI middleware (e.g., `fastapi-prometheus`) that integrates with the request/response cycle.
    * **Tools:** [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for efficient time-series data collection of these metrics. [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for building real-time dashboards to visualize RPS, error rates, and latency, often broken down by endpoint.
    * **Alerting:** Implement immediate alerts (via Alertmanager) for:
        * A sudden and significant decrease in RPS (e.g., a drop below a baseline for a given time of day).
        * The 5xx error rate exceeding a minimal threshold (e.g., >0.5% or >1% of all requests are 5xx) or a specific count within a short time window.
